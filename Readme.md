# Map for WinForms - Create Different Map Shapes

This example shows how to create map shapes andÂ add them to a vector layer. 

![](Images/resulting-map.png)

Follow the steps below to add map shapes to the map:

1. Add a [VectorItemsLayer](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.VectorItemsLayer) object to the [MapControl.Layers](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapControl.Layers) collection.
2. Initialize the [VectorItemsLayer.Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.VectorItemsLayer.Data) property with a [MapItemStorage](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapItemStorage) object.
3. Add shape objects to the [MapItemStorage.Items](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapItemStorage.Items) collection.

The following shapes are available:

* [MapBubble](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapBubble)
* [MapCallout](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapCallout)
* [MapCustomElement](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapCustomElement)
* [MapDot](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapDot)
* [MapEllipse](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapEllipse)
* [MapLine](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapLine)
* [MapPath](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapPath)
* [MapPie](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapPie)
* [MapPolygon](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapPolygon)
* [MapPolyline](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapPolyline)
* [MapPushpin](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapPushpin)
* [MapRectangle](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapRectangle)
* [MapSpline](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.MapSpline)
